01_clean_data.py

Reads the raw SIPRI Arms Transfers Database export (Trade Register CSV),
cleans it, and prepares it for analysis.

Input:  data/raw/1995-2025.csv
Output: data/processed/deliveries_clean.csv       (2004-2025, all rows)
        data/processed/edges_cross_sections.csv   (supplier-recipient-TIV for the 5 cross-sections)

Notes on SIPRI's export format:
- The first 11 rows are metadata/description text (not the table) -> skipped with skiprows=11
- Line endings are Windows-style (\\r\\n) -- pandas handles this automatically
- The last column name has a stray trailing ";" character -> renamed
- "Delivery year" and "TIV delivery values" already come split out per row
  (allocated by year); no further computation/splitting is needed
